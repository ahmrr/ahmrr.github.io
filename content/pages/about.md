I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/) in May 2024. I love making, learning, and doing stuff. I enjoy all things CS, including (but not exclusively) full-stack web development, microcontroller/microprocessor programming, FPGA programming, circuit design, plenty of things related to linear algebra (like robot kinematics and computer graphics), and so much more.

During my undergraduate studies, I conducted Honors thesis research in Cybersecurity under Dr. [Zhenkai Zhang](https://zhenkai-zhang.github.io/). My research generally focuses on computer systems security; in Summer/Fall 2023, I worked on a project evaluating the feasibility of bit disturbance error attacks, such as [Rowhammer](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf) and [RowPress](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17061.pdf), launched from discrete GPUs. Since Spring 2024, I have been working on an extension of my Honors thesis project that involves developing a secure ECU hardware platform for automotive vehicles, which uses FPGA-based RISC-V Rocket CPU cores and the Keystone TEE platform.

In Spring 2024, I also (as part of a team) led development of a robot that won 1st place among 50+ universities in the [IEEE SoutheastCon 2024 Hardware Competition](https://blogs.clemson.edu/electrical-and-computer-engineering/clemsons-ieee-robotics-team-wins-2024-southeastcon-hardware-competition)! My work on this robot has taught me a lot about microcontrollers, and has allowed me to apply circuit design skills I learned prior.

After graduating from college at the age of 16, I have learned that the sky truly is the limit if I have curiosity and discipline. I am indebted to my father for schooling, mentoring, and helping me throughout this amazing journey! I can't wait to see where life takes me.
