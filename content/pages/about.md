I'm just your average 16-year-old college senior.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/). I love making, learning, and doing stuff. I enjoy all things CS, including (but not exclusively) full-stack web development, microcontroller/microprocessor programming, FPGA programming, circuit design, plenty of things related to linear algebra (like robot kinematics and computer graphics), and so much more.

I'm presently conducting Honors thesis research in Cybersecurity under Dr. [Zhenkai Zhang](https://zhenkai-zhang.github.io/). My research generally focuses on computer systems security; in Summer/Fall 2023, I worked on a project evaluating the feasibility of bit disturbance error attacks, such as [Rowhammer](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf) and [RowPress](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17061.pdf), launched from discrete GPUs. Currently, I am working on a project that involves developing a secure ECU hardware platform for automotive vehicles using RISC-V.

I'm also (as part of a team) developing a robot to compete in the [IEEE SoutheastCon 2024 Hardware Competition](https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/). My work on this robot has taught me a lot about microcontrollers, and has allowed me to apply circuit design skills I learned prior.

I’m a work-ethical, motivated, and self-driven individual. I’ve learned professional problem-solving and analytical skills from a young age, thanks to a highly academic household.
