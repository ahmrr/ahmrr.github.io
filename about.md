# about me

## and my life

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/). I love making, learning, and *doing* stuff. I enjoy all things CS, but I especially love web dev.

I'm a work-ethical, motivated, and self-driven individual. I've learned professional problem-solving and analytical skills from a young age, thanks to an educational household.
