I"¼<h1>about me</h1>

<h2>and my life</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a>. I love making, learning, and <em>doing</em> stuff. I enjoy all things CS, but I especially love web dev.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a work-ethical, motivated, and self-driven individual. Iâ€™ve learned professional problem-solving and analytical skills from a young age, thanks to an educational household.</p>
