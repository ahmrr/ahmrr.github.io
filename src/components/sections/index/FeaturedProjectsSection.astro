        projectTitle="Private and Efficient Surveillance using Sample Pooling"
        projectDescription="Sample pooling is cost-effective, statistically efficient, and private, all for free!â„¢"

        <!-- We characterize the inherent differential privacy guarantees of sample
        pooling; counterintuitively, sample pooling can simultaneously provide
        better estimation efficiency and privacy than conventional unpooled
        testing. We also discuss ways to optimally achieve a specific privacy
        level. -->

    <ProjectCard
        projectTitle="Large-Scale Hawkes Process Modeling of Social Media Data"
        projectDescription="Hawkes processes are flexible, interpretable, and can capture sophisticated interactions, but severely suffer from scaling."

    >
        <!-- With the goal of fitting a multivariate Hawkes model to a dataset with
        ~217M events and ~85K event types, we look at novel optimizations to
        large-scale Hawkes processes that enable drastic speedups. We also
        provide a feature-rich, open-source, optimized PyTorch Hawkes process
        library. -->
