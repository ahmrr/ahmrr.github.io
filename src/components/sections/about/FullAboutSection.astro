        I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Clemson
        University in May 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted
        Honors thesis research in cybersecurity under Dr. Zhenkai Zhang. My
        research generally focused on computer systems security; in Summer and
        Fall 2023, I worked on a project evaluating the feasibility of bit
        disturbance error attacks, such as Rowhammer and RowPress, launched from
        discrete GPUs. In Spring and Fall 2024, I worked on an extension of my
        Honors thesis project that involves developing a secure ECU hardware
        platform for automotive vehicles using the FPGA-based RISC-V Rocket CPU
        architexture, the Keystone TEE platform, and moving target defenses.

        In Spring 2024, I also (as part of a team) led development of a robot
        that won 1st place among 50+ universities in the IEEE SoutheastCon 2024
        Hardware Competition! My work on this robot has taught me a lot about
        microcontrollers, and has allowed me to apply circuit design skills I
        learned prior.

        Aside from my current automotive security research, I am undertaking a
        Master’s degree in Math at Clemson, which I expect to finish in August
        2025. As part of the degree, I am conducting research at the
        intersection of statistics and differential privacy, co-advised by Dr.
        Rafael G. L. D’Oliveira and Dr. Christopher McMahan.
