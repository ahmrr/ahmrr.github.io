        We characterize the inherent differential privacy guarantees of sample
        pooling; counterintuitively, sample pooling can simultaneously provide
        better estimation efficiency and privacy than conventional unpooled
        testing. We also discuss ways to optimally achieve a specific privacy
        level.

    <ProjectCard
        projectTitle="Large-Scale Hawkes Process Modeling of Social Media Data"
        projectDescription="Hawkes processes are flexible, interpretable, and can capture sophisticated interactions, but severely suffer from scaling."

    >
        With the goal of fitting a Hawkes model to a dataset with ~217M events
        and ~85K event types, we look at novel optimizations to large-scale
        Hawkes processes that enable drastic speedups. We also provide a
        feature-rich, open-source, optimized PyTorch Hawkes process library.
